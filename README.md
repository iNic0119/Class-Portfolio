# Class-Portfolio
My favorite 3 coding projects I made apart of my advance Software Development class my freshman year of RIT.

These 3 Projects consist under the titles of "Hangman", "Moonbase", and "GvT"

Each project represent different proccesses and ideas of coding as I learned them in class.

Hangman uses the ideas of Configurations and Backtrackers to create and solve an interactive game of "Hangman"

Moonbase uses synchronized keys, enums, classes and their implemntation to allow virtual rovers to share a tunnel and manage traffic.

GvT creates an arena for virtual fightrs that use different parent and child classes to have virtual goat classes fight.

Finally in this repository there is an Vulnerability Assessment report formed for my cybersecuirty group final project. While it was split between four people I took leadership role of organzing and overseeing the report. I kept my group mates on track and organized. I created an outline of responsibilities for my group and took the opportunities to do extra work when it could not be evenly split also taking some of the more in depth responsibilities. Overall I really enjoyed the making of the report, learning many different skills especially in the making of reports, and working in a group setting and taking on a leadership role for the project.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work and I appreciate the opportunity dearly.
